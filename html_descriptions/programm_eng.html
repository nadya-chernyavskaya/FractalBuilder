This is an easy to use application to build and study fractals. The application builds a Mandelbrot set from any user-defined complex function. Once the fractal (Mandelbrot set) is build, you can infinitely zoom-in to explore its structure. You can also choose a point on the fractal to build a Julia set from. Users can choose among different color-schemes and save all created images.

<b>About Mandelbrot and Julia sets</b>
<br />
Let <b>F(z)</b> a complex function, <b>P(z)</b> - a polynomial with zero constant term, and <b>z</b> and <b>c</b> - complex numbers. The F(z) takes shape of <b>F(z) = P(z) + c</b>. Consider the following sequence:
<br />
 z<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>1</sub> = F(z<sub>0</sub>), z<sub>2</sub> = F(F(z<sub>0</sub>)) = F(z<sub>1</sub>),
 <br/>
  z<sub>3</sub>=F(F(F(z<sub>0</sub>))) = F(z<sub>2</sub>) ...
<br />
  <b>The Mandelbrot set </b>— is the set of all <b>c</b> ϵ ₵, for which {z<sub>n</sub>}, starting from z = 0, does not diverge to infinity. The original Mandelbrot set is defined for <b>F(z) = z<sup>2</sup> + c</b>, but other polynominals, and different function can be used to generate the sequence {z<sub>n</sub>}.
<br />
 <b> The Julia set </b> for a given complex number <b>c</b> - is the set of all <b>z<sub>0</sub></b> for which the sequence {z<sub>n</sub>} does not diverge to infinity. It can also be defined informally, as the set of such z<sub>0</sub>, for which an arbitrarily small change in value can cause drastic changes in the {z<sub>n</sub>} sequence of iterated function values.
