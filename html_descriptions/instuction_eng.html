The main window of the application is divided into 4 parts:
<br />
<br />
1) The main window with a fractal image is in the middle.
<br />
<br />
2) The complex function to build the Madelbrot set from <b> f(z) </b> is specified in the window at the bottom. The function can contain arithmetic operations +, -, *, /, ^, brackets, trigonometric functions sin(z), cos(z), tg(z), ctg(z), exponent exp(), real numbers and complex numbers in the a+bi format.
<br />
If you see an error message after your enter the function, check that :
<br />
 - expression contains the variables <b>z</b> and <b>c</b>
<br />
 - there is no power function with non-integer exponent
<br/>
 - there are only allowed symbols in the function expression
<br />
 - the delimiters and brackets are correctly placed.
<br />
If you like the produced fractal and want to save the function, you can add it to 'Favorites'. To do this click the star-shaped button 'Add to Favorites', and the function will be added to the 'Favorites' list on the left.
<br />
To draw a Julia set for a given point, you need to specify the point coordinates (Re(c), Im(c)) and the number of iterations to infinity (n). You can either specify them yourself in the window to the right from the star-shaped button, or simply double-click on any point on the current Mandelbrot set  to automatically fill them in.
<br /> 
<br />
3) The toolbar is placed on the right side. You can explore the created fractal by zooming-in and -out, moving to the left and right, and adjusting the color scheme. To move left and right, you can also use arrow-keys.
<br />
<br />
4) On the left-hand side there are two fields. In the upper field, you can select a function from a list examples, while the lower field has a list of functions that were added to <b>Favorites</b>. To clear the 'Favorites' list or to adjust it, use the right-click.
<br /> 	
<br />

You can save the fractal image in .jpg and .png formats. To specify the resolution and the size of the image, click on <b>Parameters</b> in the top panel. Keep in mind, that fractals with large resolution will take longer to produce. You can also save the function 'Favorites' list in the .frac format. This list can then be loaded later. To save the image, or save/load the function list, select <b>File</b > -> <b>Save</b>, <b>Open</b> in the control panel.
